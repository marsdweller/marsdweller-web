This map was designed for an audience that is not familiar with flight paths or for people who are curious about flight paths. The map interactively allows its users to input the IATA code for airports and serve up both an 'Origin' and 'Destination' locations. An additional button then allows the user to draw a flight path based on a great circle connecting the two locations.
